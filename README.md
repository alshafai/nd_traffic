# Motivation & Objective
Traffic accidents poses a serious challenge to authorities in Saudi Arabia attempting to tackle this issue and reduce the number of accidents as well as fatalities caused by these accidents. In Thakaa Challenge for Road Safety, traffic accident data is provided for thirty six thousand accident that occurred on intercity roads between 2017 and April 2019. I attempt to study the data and get some insight if certain locations, time or other factors can be considered risk factors that can help authorities focus their efforts. 

# Key Results
in investigating the timing of the accidents. A pattern emerged in which traffic accidents rate was higher in the period from March to June. When considering the timing of the day, it is been shown that accidents number peak at 8 pm and they continue to decline throughout the afternoon until the evening. In terms of the location of the accidents, it is been shown that the top 3 regions in terms of accident numbers account for more than half of all accidents. This does provide the change to make these regions a priority.
